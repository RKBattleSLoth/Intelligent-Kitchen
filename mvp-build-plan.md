# MVP Build Plan: Intelligent Kitchen AI

## Executive Summary

Based on the PRD analysis, the MVP will focus on the four core features: **Pantry Management**, **Smart Meal Planning**, **Intelligent Grocery List Generation**, and **Natural Language Interaction**. The build plan prioritizes functionality over advanced AI capabilities, with a phased approach to ensure a stable foundation.

## Technical Architecture (MVP)

### Stack Selection
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js, Python for AI services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (users, meal plans), MongoDB (pantry, recipes), Redis (caching)
- **AI/ML**: Integration with external APIs (Google Speech-to-Text, Spoonacular)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers, cloud deployment (AWS/Azure)

### Core Services
1. **User Service**: Authentication, profiles, preferences
2. **Pantry Service**: Inventory management, expiration tracking
3. **Meal Planning Service**: Recipe management, calendar integration
4. **Grocery Service**: List generation, aisle organization
5. **NLP Service**: Voice/text command processing

## Key Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **AI Integration Complexity**
   - *Risk*: External API dependencies may cause delays
   - *Mitigation*: Implement fallback options and mock services

2. **Database Performance**
   - *Risk*: Complex queries may slow down the app
   - *Mitigation*: Implement caching and optimize queries early

3. **Voice Recognition Accuracy**
   - *Risk*: Poor performance in real-world conditions
   - *Mitigation*: Start with text-based interface, add voice as enhancement

### Business Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - *Risk*: Adding too many features to MVP
   - *Mitigation*: Strict prioritization and scope definition

2. **User Adoption**
   - *Risk*: Complex interface may deter users
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on intuitive design and smooth onboarding
