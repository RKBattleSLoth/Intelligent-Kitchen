## Architecture Flow

### Simple Query Flow
```
User: "What temperature to bake chicken?"
  ↓
[Small Model] → Direct response
  ↓
User: "375°F (190°C)"
```

### Query with Tools Flow
```
User: "What recipes can I make with what I have?"
  ↓
[Small Model] → Analyzes intent: pantry_analysis
  ↓
[Medium Model] → Decides to use tools:
  1. get_pantry_items()
  2. search_recipes(ingredients=pantry_items)
  ↓
[Tools Execute] → Returns data
  ↓
[Medium Model] → Processes results, makes recommendations
  ↓
[Small Model] → Formats friendly response
  ↓
User: "Based on your pantry, here are 5 recipes..."
```

### Complex Meal Planning Flow
```
User: "Create a 7-day meal plan"
  ↓
[Small Model] → Analyzes: meal_planning
  ↓
[Medium Model] → Tool sequence:
  1. get_pantry_items()
  2. search_recipes(filters)
  3. create_meal_plan(name, dates)
  4. add_meal_to_plan() × 21 (7 days × 3 meals)
  5. generate_grocery_list_from_meal_plan()
  ↓
[Tools Execute] → Creates actual meal plan in database
  ↓
[Medium Model] → Summarizes what was created
  ↓
[Small Model] → Presents plan to user
  ↓
User: "I've created a 7-day meal plan... [details]"
```

  ↓
[Small Model] → Intent: add_pantry_item
  ↓
[Medium Model] → Tools:
  - add_pantry_item({name: "chicken breast", quantity: 1, unit: "pounds"})
  - add_pantry_item({name: "milk", quantity: 1, unit: "liters"})
  ↓
Result: Items added to database
  ↓
User: "I've added chicken breast and milk to your pantry!"
```

### Example 2: Check Recipe Feasibility
```
User: "Can I make spaghetti carbonara?"
  ↓
[Medium Model] → Tools:
  1. search_recipes({name: "spaghetti carbonara"}) 
     → Returns recipe_id
  2. check_pantry_for_recipe({recipeId: "..."})
     → Returns: {canMake: false, missing: ["eggs", "bacon"]}
  ↓
User: "You're missing eggs and bacon. Would you like me to add them to a grocery list?"
```

### Example 3: Create Meal Plan
```
User: "Plan my meals for next week"
  ↓
[Medium Model] → Tools:
  1. get_pantry_items() → Get available ingredients
  2. search_recipes({...}) → Find suitable recipes
  3. create_meal_plan({name: "Week of Jan 1", startDate, endDate})
  4. add_meal_to_plan() × 21 times
  5. generate_grocery_list_from_meal_plan()
  ↓
Result: Complete meal plan in database + grocery list
  ↓
User: "I've created a meal plan with 21 meals and a grocery list for missing ingredients!"
```
