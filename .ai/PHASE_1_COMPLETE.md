## Testing Readiness

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **OpenRouter Configuration**
   - [ ] Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`
   - [ ] Set model identifiers (Small, Medium, Large)
   - [ ] Verify status endpoint: `GET /api/ai/status`

2. **Basic Chat**
   - [ ] Test simple query: "What temperature to bake chicken?"
   - [ ] Test complex query: "Suggest recipes using chicken and vegetables"
   - [ ] Verify model selection logic

3. **Vision Features**
   - [ ] Upload food image
   - [ ] Test image analysis
   - [ ] Verify Large model usage

4. **Database**
   - [ ] Run migration: `npm run migrate`
   - [ ] Verify all AI tables created
   - [ ] Check indexes

## What's Working

✅ **Small Model (Conversational)**
- Handles all user interactions
- Analyzes intent
- Provides direct responses for simple queries
- Delegates complex requests

✅ **Medium Model (Logic)**
- Receives delegated tasks from Small model
- Performs reasoning and planning
- Returns structured results

✅ **Large Model (Data)**
- Processes vision requests
- Ready for bulk data analysis (Phase 2)
- 1M token context for comprehensive processing

✅ **Communication**
- Models successfully pass data between tiers
- Conversation tracking works
- Message history maintained

## What's Next (Phase 2)

### Phase 2: Tool Integration & Skills Framework
1. **ToolRegistry Implementation**
   - Database tools (CRUD operations)
   - Calculation tools (nutrition, units)
   - API integration tools
   - Image processing tools
   - Notification tools

2. **Medium Model Tool Usage**
   - Function calling integration
   - Tool execution framework
   - Result aggregation

3. **Actual Data Integration**
   - Connect to real pantry data
   - Access recipe database
   - User preference loading
   - Meal plan integration

4. **Cost Monitoring**
   - Usage tracking implementation
   - Cost calculation
   - Alert system

5. **Caching System**
   - Response cache implementation
   - Cache invalidation logic
   - Performance optimization

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
# Copy and edit .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Add your OpenRouter API key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxxxx

# Select your models (examples)
OPENROUTER_MODEL_SMALL=anthropic/claude-3-haiku
OPENROUTER_MODEL_MEDIUM=anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
OPENROUTER_MODEL_LARGE=google/gemini-1.5-pro
```

### 3. Run Database Migration
```bash
npm run migrate
```

### 4. Start Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test AI Endpoints

**Check Status:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/ai/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Simple Chat:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/ai/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What temperature to bake chicken?"}'
```

**Image Analysis:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/ai/chat/image \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@path/to/food.jpg" \
  -F "message=What ingredients do you see?"
```

## Known Limitations (To Be Addressed in Phase 2)

- ⚠️ Medium model doesn't use tools yet (no database operations)
- ⚠️ Large model data processing is placeholder (awaits tool integration)
- ⚠️ No actual pantry data passed to models
- ⚠️ No cost monitoring yet
- ⚠️ No response caching implementation
- ⚠️ Tool calling not yet implemented
