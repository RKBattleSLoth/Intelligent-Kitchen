# Agent Architecture Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a sophisticated multi-agent architecture on top of the existing collaborative AI system, providing specialized agents for different domains and intelligent request routing.

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. Request Router ✅
**File:** `backend/src/services/ai/RequestRouter.js`

Intelligent request analysis and routing system that:
- Analyzes request complexity (simple, medium, complex)
- Extracts user intents (meal planning, pantry, recipes, etc.)
- Determines optimal model tier (small/medium/large)
- Calculates temperature and token requirements
- Implements LRU caching for common queries
- Routes requests to appropriate processing path

**Key Features:**
- Complexity scoring based on multiple factors
- Intent classification (10 different intent types)
- Context-aware prompt building
- Smart temperature adjustment
- Token estimation

### 2. Coordinator Agent ✅
**File:** `backend/src/services/ai/agents/CoordinatorAgent.js`

Multi-agent orchestration system that:
- Creates execution plans for complex requests
- Coordinates multiple specialist agents
- Synthesizes results into coherent responses
- Handles errors and fallbacks gracefully
- Tracks execution steps

**Workflow:**
1. **Plan Creation** - Breaks down user request into steps
2. **Execution** - Runs each step with appropriate agent
3. **Context Enrichment** - Passes results between agents
4. **Synthesis** - Combines results into user-friendly response

## 🎯 Request Flow Examples

### Simple Request (Small Model Only)
```
User: "What temperature to bake chicken?"
  ↓
[RequestRouter] analyzes: complexity=0.1, no tools needed
  ↓
[Small Model] responds directly: "375°F (190°C)"
  ↓
Response time: ~400ms
Cost: $0.00025
```

### Tool-Based Request (Small + Medium)
```
User: "Add chicken breast to my pantry"
  ↓
[RequestRouter] analyzes: complexity=0.4, needs tools
  ↓
[CollaborativeInference] routes to Medium model
  ↓
[Medium Model] calls: add_pantry_item(name="Chicken Breast", ...)
  ↓
[ToolRegistry] executes database INSERT
  ↓
[Small Model] formats: "Added chicken breast to your pantry!"
  ↓
Response time: ~1.5s
Cost: $0.005
```

### Complex Multi-Agent Request
```
User: "Plan my meals for next week"
  ↓
[RequestRouter] analyzes: complexity=0.8, needs coordination
  ↓
[CoordinatorAgent] creates plan:
  Step 1: pantry.check_inventory
  Step 2: recipe.find_recipes (count=21)
  Step 3: meal.create_plan (duration=7)
  ↓
[PantryAgent] executes:
  - get_pantry_items() → Returns 24 items
  ↓
[RecipeAgent] executes:
  - search_recipes(ingredients=[...]) → Returns 50 recipes
  ↓
[Large Model] processes bulk data:
  - Analyzes 50 recipes
  - Selects best 21 for variety/nutrition
  ↓
[MealPlanAgent] executes:
  - create_meal_plan()
  - add_meal_to_plan() × 21
  - generate_grocery_list_from_meal_plan()
  ↓
[Small Model] synthesizes friendly response
  ↓
Response time: ~4s
Cost: $0.015
Models used: Small, Medium, Large
Tools executed: 25+
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

### Factors Considered
1. **Keywords** - plan, schedule, generate, create, optimize (+0.3)
2. **Data Volume** - Large pantry/recipe lists (+0.2)
3. **Constraints** - Multiple AND/BUT/WITH conditions (+0.1 each)
4. **Temporal** - Week/month/schedule references (+0.2)
5. **Optimization** - best/most/least/minimize (+0.25)
6. **Entity Count** - Multiple items/recipes/meals (+0.2)

### Complexity Score Mapping
- **0.0 - 0.3** → Small model (simple queries)
- **0.3 - 0.7** → Medium model (logic + tools)
- **0.7 - 1.0** → Large model or multi-agent (complex workflows)

---

## 🎨 Agent Communication Protocol

### Data Passing Between Agents
```javascript
// Step 1: Pantry Agent
pantryResult = { items: [...], count: 24 }

// Step 2: Recipe Agent receives
context.pantry_result = pantryResult
recipeResult = { recipes: [...], count: 50 }

// Step 3: Meal Plan Agent receives
context.pantry_result = pantryResult
context.recipe_result = recipeResult
mealPlanResult = { plan: {...}, groceryList: {...} }
```

### Context Enrichment
Each agent enriches the context for subsequent agents:
- Previous results available
- Intermediate data preserved
- Error information propagated
- Processing metadata tracked
