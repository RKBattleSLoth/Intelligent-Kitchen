# Railway Meal Planning Debug Report

## Issues Identified

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration
- **Local**: Uses `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@postgres:5432/intelligent_kitchen_dev`
- **Railway**: Needs Railway's PostgreSQL environment variables properly set

### 2. Authentication Issues
- Authentication middleware has fallback logic for meal planning requests
- Recent commits show Railway authentication fixes were attempted
- The fallback mechanism may not work correctly on Railway

### 3. Database Connection
- Database configuration is designed for Railway but may have SSL or connection issues
- Pool settings might not be optimal for Railway's environment

### 4. OpenRouter AI Service
- API key needs to be set in Railway environment
- Network requests may fail or timeout on Railway

## Root Cause Analysis

The meal planning functionality depends on:
1. **Database connectivity** - for storing/retrieving meal plans and recipes
2. **Authentication** - for user-specific meal planning
3. **AI service** - OpenRouter API for generating meal plans

Most likely, one of these three components is failing on Railway while working locally.

## Immediate Fixes Needed

1. Verify Railway environment variables
2. Check Railway deployment logs
3. Test database connectivity on Railway
4. Verify OpenRouter API key is set and accessible
5. Fix authentication middleware for Railway environment

## Testing Plan

1. Deploy with enhanced logging
2. Test meal planning endpoint directly
3. Check each dependency in isolation
4. Verify fallback behavior works correctly
